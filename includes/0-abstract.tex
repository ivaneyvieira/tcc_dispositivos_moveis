This paper presents the development of a mobile application using data collectors, focused on product counting for stock balance correction in warehouses. The Kanban methodology was employed for requirements gathering, allowing for agile and flexible development. The application was developed using Flutter for the presentation layer and Spring Boot for the service layer, with a MySQL database. Key features include integration with existing management systems, product movement tracking, barcode scanning, and automated alerts. The interface was designed to be intuitive, facilitating use by managers and auditors. User experience was a focal point during development, with Figma used for prototyping and usability testing. Results indicate that the adoption of modern technologies can significantly enhance inventory processes, reducing errors and improving stock management. It is concluded that, in addition to technology, well-defined processes and adequate user training are essential for the systemâ€™s effectiveness. The study emphasizes the importance of an integrated approach, combining technology with well-structured management practices to optimize inventory control in warehouses.
