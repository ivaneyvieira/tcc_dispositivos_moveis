This work aims to develop an inventory management application to optimize the control and organization of stock in warehouses. In Brazilâ€™s dynamic retail landscape, inventory errors are a significant challenge, impacting process efficiency and customer satisfaction. Implementing cyclical inventories improves stock accuracy and management, promoting operational efficiency and reducing costs. The proposed application has two modules: one for auditors, which allows product counting via mobile devices, and another for managers, offering comprehensive tools for registration, batch management, auditing and report generation. With integration into existing systems, product movement tracking and support for barcode scanning, the application aims to maximize efficiency and transparency in stock management. Ongoing training and technical support ensure effective adoption of the system, making it an essential solution for companies in a wide range of sectors.
