This work aims to develop an inventory management application to optimize the control and organization of stock in warehouses. In the dynamic scenario of Brazilian retail, stock errors are a significant challenge, impacting process efficiency and customer satisfaction. Implementing cyclic inventories improves stock accuracy and management, promoting operational efficiency and cost reduction. The proposed application has two modules: one for auditors, allowing product counting via mobile devices, and another for managers, offering comprehensive tools for product registration, batch management, auditing, and report generation. With integration to existing systems, product movement tracking, and support for barcodes reading, the application aims to maximize efficiency and transparency in stock management. Training and continuous technical support ensure effective system adoption, standing out as an essential solution for companies across various sectors.
